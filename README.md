# Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities. Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
# Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm
In this project we Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to  predict the right class accordingly.
